PTM Go vs C++ port notes (2026-01-31)

COMPLETED:
1. ✓ Full PTM config parsing (IDR/CTRL/CCER). Applied to decoder flags.
2. ✓ Processor with unsync scanning (finds ASYNC, emits raw data).
3. ✓ Packet types: TRIGGER, WPOINT_UPDATE, IGNORE, unsync markers (NOTSYNC, INCOMPLETE_EOT, BAD_SEQUENCE, RESERVED).
4. ✓ Parser extensions for TRIGGER/WPOINT_UPDATE + config-based ContextID sizing.
5. ✓ Decode FSM parity (8 states: NO_SYNC/WAIT_SYNC/WAIT_ISYNC/DECODE_PKTS/CONT*).
6. ✓ Waypoint update + TRACE_TO_ADDR_INCL/EXCL behaviors (2026-01-31).
7. ✓ Instruction follower config: DSB/DMB waypoint, WFI/WFE handling (2026-01-31).

REMAINING:
8. Tighten golden tests (timestamp accumulation, ADDR_NACC matching).
9. Comparison with C++ output format (instruction attribute strings like "E BR b+link").

STATUS (2026-01-31):
- Waypoint update packet parsing and processing now fully implemented
- Traces to waypoint address with inclusive semantics  
- DSB/DMB barriers handled as waypoints when configured
- Go decoder producing output on tc2-ptm-rstk-t32 snapshot
- Created ptm_verify.go tool for easy output comparison
- Output is semantically correct but formatting differs from C++

NEXT STEPS:
- Add instruction attribute formatting (branch type, link, return, condition flags)
- Run full test suite against tc2 snapshot
- Validate timestamp accumulation and ADDR_NACC behavior
